## LakBootstrap

_This project is to be used with [Lak](https://github.com/RubbaBoy/Lak)_

LakBootstrap is a simple single-binary to be copied over and ran on a Raspberry Pi to automatically update the Lak Docker image if required before running it. Also provides simple options to stay at the current version and run at an arbitrary version. With the docker deployment of Lak, this allows for the starting of an image off of a specific commit automatically.
